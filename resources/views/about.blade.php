                    Lee Hye-ri (Hangul: 이혜리; born June 9, 1994), better known mononymously as Hyeri, is a South Korean singer, actress and television personality. She rose to fame as the youngest member of girl group Girl's Day, and was named as the "Nation's Little Sister" by the South Korean media due to her immense popularity after appearing as a fixed cast member on Real Men (2014).

                    She later became known for her leading role in television drama Reply 1988 (2015), which was the highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history at the time. She ranked third in Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list in 2016, and is one of the highest-paid commercial models in South Korea. She was a regular cast member on Amazing Saturday (2018-2020).


                    Lee Hyeri is a South Korean idol singer, dancer, model and actress. She is best known for being the maknae in K-Pop girl group Girl’s Day.

                    Hyeri was one of two new members (the other being the perfect Yura) that Dream Tea Entertainment brought in to replace Jiin and Jisun back in June of 2010. Let’s just say that Dream Tea really hit it out of the park (Don’t take my word for it, Tony Ahn saw it too). Hyeri is pretty much the textbook maknae. She’s never going to get the most amount of lines or even get many moments to shine but she’s striking enough to hold her own visually. In a group that has Sojin, Yura and Minah, that’s no small feat, that’s a damn miracle. Bottom line: Hyeri is very pretty, does adequate filler work for Girl’s Day and she has the legs of an Amazonian goddess.
